## How do we drive music animation?

There are 2 different approaches to driving a music animation:

1. FFT based approach- where you input an audio file (.wav, .mp3, etc) and have the visual elements react to the audio data. The audio data is filtered with steep inverse notch filters on selected frequencies. With the filtered data, you can then use the amplitude of the signal to drive animation parameters.

2. Preactive approach using a MIDI file. A MIDI file is read in and broken down into its components. Animation curves get “copied” throughout the duration of the MIDI file, based on sets of parameters, typically determined by the notes in the MIDI file. The MIDI file determines when animations are being copied. This is the way MIDIAnimator works.

## Process of creating a MIDI animation with MIDIAnimator (front/backend):
MIDI files are broken down using the `MIDIFile()` class. `MIDIFile()` takes 1 parameter, which is the file where the MIDI file is stored. 

`MIDIFile()` will create `MIDITrack()`, `MIDINote()` and `MIDIEvent()` objects based on the data inside of the MIDI file. 

Structure of a `MIDIFile()` object:

```
MIDIFile:
	file: string (where the MIDI file is stored)
	tracks: list of MIDITrack objects

	MIDITrack:
		name: string
		notes: list of MIDINote objects
		control change: associative array that maps a control change number to a list of MIDIEvent values
		aftertouch: list of MIDIEvent values
		pitchwheel: list of MIDIEvent values

		MIDINote:
			channel: integer
			noteNumber: integer
			velocity: integer
			timeOn: float, in seconds
			timeOff: float, in seconds
		
		MIDIEvent:
			channel: integer
			value: float
			time: float, in seconds
```

To get specific `MIDITrack` objects, use the `MIDIFile.findTrack()` method.

To start adding instruments, instance a `MIDIAnimatorNode()` object

* Use the `MIDIAnimatorNode.addInsturment()` method to add an instrument.
    * Takes a `MIDITrack`, `bpy.types.Collection`. *
	* On instrument creation, `makeObjToFCurvesDict()` is called
	    * Gets each Blender Object in a collection, gets their FCurves and creates `ObjectFCurves()` objects
	* & `createNoteToBlenderObject()` is called
	    *  Gets all Blender Objects in a collection, and creates `BlenderObject()` (a wrapper for a `bpy.types.Object`) objects, 
        & adds their corresponding `ObjectFCurves` objects

Call the `MIDIAnimatorNode.animate()` method to animate all instruments.

* Given each instrument in the `MIDIAnimatorNode()` instruments list: 
    * `preFrameLoop()` is called 
        * `createFrameRanges()` is called
        	* creates `FrameRange()` objects with the starting and ending frame for each note (based on its FCurve), and finds its corresponding Blender object.
        * `preAnimate()` is called
        	* `pass` by default.
    * `animateFrames()` is called
    	* `instrument.updateActiveObjectList()` gets called for every frame in the MIDI file
    		* Removes and adds objects in the list of things being animated
    	* `instrument.animate()` gets called for every frame in the MIDIFile
    		* Looks at all objects in the active object list	
    		* Loops over all objects, and applies the animation to them
    * `postFrameLoop()` is called
    	* Deletes all unnecessary information left over (clears all instance variables)

## Dealing with overlapping animation:
In Figure A, we are given a simple dampened oscillation function.

If we were to animate Figure A using a simple MIDI file (2 notes, with the notes overlapping), it would look something like Figure B.

However, there is a fundamental problem, as there is overlapping animation (denoted by the question mark in Figure B).

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>


To deal with the overlapping animation, we can simply add the 2 animation curves together, shown in Figure C.

</div>


### Problems with this approach:
If the motion is not oscillating, the motion will be added together, in a result which is not desirable. 
More techniques in dealing with overlapping animation will need to be researched.
